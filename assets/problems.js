        "solution": "<i>Solution 1:</i> We first group some terms as follows: $(x^2-6x)+(y^2-10y)=-18$, then we complete the square within each group. In the first group, the linear term has coefficient $-6$, so the constant term is $(-6/2)^2=9$. Similarly, in the second group, the constant term should be $(-10/2)^2=25$. Hence, we add $9+25$ to both sides to get $(x^2-6x+9)+(y^2-10y+25)=-18+9+25$. We can factor each group in the left side and simplify the right side to get our standard form: $\boxed{(x-3)^2+(y-5)^2=16}$.<br><br><i>Solution 2:</i>Note that the general form of the equation is $x^2-6x+y^2-10x+18=0$. Recall that in the general form of a circle equation, $x^2+y^2+Dx+Ey+F=0$, where the center of the circle is $(h,k)$ and the length of the radius is $r$, we have $D=-2h$, $E=-2k$, and $F=h^2+k^2-r^2$. (These can be derived by expanding the standard form.) Thus, we have that $-6=-2h$ and $-10=-2k$, so $h=3$ and $k=5$. This gives us that $18=3^2+5^2-r^2=34-r^2$, so $r^2=34-18=16$. Therefore, the standard form of the equation is $\boxed{(x-3)^2+(y-5)^2=16}$."
